# akzidenz
Hello! Go explore some of my projects or [AkzidenzGrotesk-py.github.io](https://akzidenzgrotesk-py.github.io/).

### Projects
*All (a large portion) of my projects have README.md and DOC.md, read those for more info.*
- [/WindowsBatch/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/WindowsBatch) - Some programming projects written in Windows Batch.
- [/CasioBasic/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/CasioBasic) - Casio BASIC programming projects. Casio BASIC is the programming language used on Casio devices, you can actually write C for the calculator-- but where's the fun in that?
- [/PythonProjects/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/PythonProjects) - My python projects that are not interesting enough to be placed somewhere of value.
- [/TypeDesign/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/TypeDesign) - My type and typography projects, most of them are very low quality and not well kerned.
