# akzidenz
Hello! Go explore some of my projects or [AkzidenzGrotesk-py.github.io](https://akzidenzgrotesk-py.github.io/index.html).

Most of the stuff here is personal projects and side things, some odd scripts and such. Sort of messes like [this factor tree script in Python](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/PythonProjects/blob/main/console/factor_tree.py) or [this Mandelbrot fractal in C](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/OtherProjects/blob/main/c/mandelbrot.c).

I draw maps, I am most proud of [this fantasy atlas style map](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/DungeonsAndDragons/blob/main/RennetaRange_GarhusTerritory_AtlasMap.png) which turned out nice, but I do other styles too.

I keep my code here as an "organized" archive. Don't expect well written code or anything.

### Projects
*All (a large portion) of my projects have README.md and DOC.md, read those for more info.*
- [/PythonProjects/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/PythonProjects) - My python projects that are not interesting enough to be placed somewhere of value.
- [/OtherProjects/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/OtherProjects) - Any programming project that is not in CBASIC, Batch or Python. Which is mostly C and JS.
- [/DungeonsAndDragons/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/DungeonsAndDragons) - D&amp;D Projects - mostly maps and art
- [/WindowsBatch/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/WindowsBatch) - Some programming projects written in Windows Batch.
- [/CasioBasic/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/CasioBasic) - Casio BASIC programming projects. Casio BASIC is the programming language used on Casio devices, you can actually write C for the calculator, which adds more flair (and speed).
- [/TypeDesign/](https://github.com/AkzidenzGrotesk-py/TypeDesign) - My type and typography projects, most of them are very low quality and not well kerned.
